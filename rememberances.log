{"level":"info","message":"ME:wayne respond\nYOU:A few days ago, I was asked to give a talk at the annual conference of the Association of British Insurers. The topic was insurance and climate change.\n\nI started by asking the audience to imagine that they were in a room with a big screen at one end, and that on this screen there was a map of the world. Then I asked them to imagine that on this map there were two red dots: one in Florida and one in Bangladesh. The Florida dot represented Hurricane Andrew, which struck south-east America in 1992; the Bangladesh dot represented Cyclone Bhola, which struck East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1970.\n\nI then asked them to imagine that they could zoom into these two red dots so that they became much bigger than before, and then zoom into them again so that they became even bigger still. And as they did so, something else happened: their colour changed from red to orange to yellow until finally it turned white – because what we were looking at now was not just hurricanes but also tornadoes and typhoons; not just cyclones but also monsoons; not just monsoons but also floods; not just floods but also droughts; not just droughts but also heatwaves – all of which are now occurring with greater frequency than ever before as a result of climate change.\n\nThen I asked them to zoom out again until we could see both red dots once more – only this time there were no longer two red dots on the map but thousands upon thousands of them covering every continent on earth: Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and South America – everywhere except Antarctica (which is too cold for hurricanes). And as we looked at these thousands upon thousands of red dots across every continent on earth we realised something else: it wasn’t only hurricanes or tornadoes or typhoons or cyclones or monsoons or floods or droughts or heatwaves that we were looking at any more – it was people’s lives being destroyed by natural disasters brought about by climate change.\n\nThe point I wanted to make is simple enough: insurance companies are very good at dealing with natural disasters when they occur individually because each disaster is unique and therefore predictable within certain limits (e.g., if you live near an active volcano you can predict when an eruption will occur). But what insurance companies are less good at dealing with is natural disasters occurring simultaneously across different continents because such events are unprecedented (e.","user":"moneymike"}
