# Fast bot is a simple bot app for Discord and the OpenAI api
## Features
*Mostly to come*
- Allows for in-chat display and adjustment of bot response settings via yaml blocks.
- Allows chat users to remove response tokens to either the beginning of messages or throughout.
    - *This eventually could be changed with natural language*
    - I.e. "Bruce is it okay if we call you Carl?"

- Logs all prompt messages and model responses (should put some limitation on this).
